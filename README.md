# Typst Package: Ohm

This package provides templates that follow the corporate identity guide of [Technische Hochschule Nürnberg Georg Simon Ohm (Ohm)](https://th-nuernberg.de).

## Versioning

During development, the version number is set to `0.X.Y`.
The `X` will be increased with every breaking change.
The `Y` will be increased with every new feature released.
However, I might forget to actually do this, in case: whoopsie! (and sorry)

During initial development, we are on version `0.1.0`.
Things might change and break at any time.
Use this package at your own risk (and use Git in case something breaks).
